== About ==
converttousrbin.sh converts Arch Linux package archives with files in /bin, /sbin or /usr/sbin into package archives with these files in /usr/bin instead.

Note that if the package has files with identical names in more than one *bin directory, this conversion will not work (probably). i.e. original package has "/bin/do-a-thing" and "/usr/sbin/do-a-thing" for some reason, the script will hopefully terminate when it tries to move them both into /usr/bin. In such an event, you're on your own.

Also note that this is a dirty hacky workaround, and that updating or rebuilding problematic packages is far more preferable.

Don't blame me if it doesn't work and/or does something it's not supposed to.

If you use a different package extension to the default *.pkg.tar.xz, you'll need to modify the script to account for this.


== How to use ==

1) Place script in a (preferably empty) directory.
2) Copy problematic package into the same directory os the script.
3a) cd into the same directory as the script (if you aren't already in there).
3b) Ensure that the script is executable
3c) Run ./converttousrbin.sh
4) Install the converted packages (# pacman -U *usrbinmove*)


== Example ==

$ mkdir ~/toconvert
$ mv converttousrbin.sh ~/toconvert
$ cp /var/cache/pacman/pkg/{v4l-utils-0.9.5-1-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz,wpa_supplicant-2.0-3-x86_64.pkg.tar.xz} ~/builds/razercfg-git/razercfg-git-20130427-1-any.pkg.tar.xz ~/toconvert
$ cd ~/toconvert
$ chmod +x converttousrbin.sh
$ ./converttousrbin.sh
razercfg done
v4l done
wpa_supplicant done
All done. Now install with pacman -U *usrbinmove*
$ sudo pacman -U *usrbinmove*
